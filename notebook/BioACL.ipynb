Von Economo encephalitis is a disorder of possible autoimmune origin that affects the midbrain, pons, basal ganglia, and substantial nigra. It is believed that this autoimmune reaction follows\\xa0an initial viral (influenza) or bacterial (streptococcal) infection. [1] The damage to these areas manifests with a wide variety of symptoms, the most common of which are sleep disorders, abnormal movements (especially parkinsonism), and neuropsychiatric disorder. [13] The pathophysiology for hypersomnolence is attributed to inflammation of the reticular activating system, ophthalmoplegia to the involvement of cranial nerve nuclei and tracts, and parkinsonism-like features to basal ganglia involvement.

Postencephalitic parkinsonism is based on the hypothesis that dopamine depletion and hypersensitive dopamine receptors result in dopamine neurotransmission imbalance. [5] In encephalitis lethargica, the parkinsonism syndrome affecting dopamine neurotransmission shows significant improvement with dopamine agonists. Von Economo described three clinical forms of encephalitis lethargica: [1] [4] [6] [11] [13] [14] Somnolent-ophthalmologic form characterized by excessive sleepiness followed by progressive confusion, stupor,\\xa0and coma. It was associated with internal ophthalmoplegia, oculogyric crisis, nystagmus, dyskinesia, pyramidal, and cerebellar signs.

[2] [3] Hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon endocrine abnormality in which parathyroid gland dysfunction causes parathyroid hormone deficiency. Subsequently, this absence or decreased level of PTH results in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increased neuromuscular irritability. Patients typically present with symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia, including myalgias, muscle spasms, twitching, new-onset seizures, and in extreme cases, tetany.

The secretion of the parathyroid hormone is inversely related to the concentration of ionized calcium in the extracellular fluid. The activity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, is affected by calcium concentration changes. As the calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid increases, this receptor is activated, and parathyroid cells decrease the secretion of parathyroid hormone. Conversely, the activity of the CaSR decreases, and parathyroid hormone secretion increases as calcium levels decline. [1] Parathyroid hormone activates the PTH receptor, another G-protein coupled receptor, increasing the resorption of calcium and phosphorus from bone, enhancing the distal tubular reabsorption of calcium, and decreasing the renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Furthermore, PTH plays an essential role in vitamin D metabolism by activating vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase, which increases the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus is subsequently increased by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and, along with PTH, facilitates bone resorption.'}\n",

[5] [6] The clinical presentation of bilious vomiting points to congenital intestinal obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater. There are cases of atresia proximal to the ampulla of Vater that present without bilious vomiting. The ampulla of Vater is located in the second or descending portion of the duodenum. Excessive bilious vomiting can cause hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria, particularly if there is a delay in hydration.

In utero, duodenal atresia, a proximal gastrointestinal tract obstruction, causes polyhydramnios by interfering with the gastrointestinal absorption of amniotic fluid swallowed by the fetus distal to the level of intestinal obstruction. Polyhydramnios is defined as abnormally large amounts of amniotic fluid in the gestational sac during pregnancy. Antenatal ultrasound is diagnostic for polyhydramnios when the amniotic fluid index is greater than 25 cm or when the total amniotic fluid is estimated to be greater than 1500 to 2000 ml. In duodenal atresia, the amniotic fluid that is swallowed by the fetus is prevented from moving distally to be absorbed by the fetal gastrointestinal tract and transferred to the maternal circulation through the placenta. Rather it is refluxed back into the amniotic fluid. Eighty percent of cases of polyhydramnios are due to maternal or idiopathic causes. Maternal causes include congestive heart failure and gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes can cause fetal hyperglycemia and fetal polyuria.

Acute steroid-induced myopathy in the critical care setting is another presentation.

Additional risk factors for corticosteroid-induced myopathy include patients with prior muscle disease or spinal cord injury, chronic respiratory illness, poor nutritional status, and a sedentary lifestyle. [5] Women are more prone to developing corticosteroid-induced myopathy, although the mechanism of this is unclear.

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is believed to occur through both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms. In terms of catabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids upregulate proteolytic systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, cathepsins (lysosomes), and calpains (calcium-dependent systems). This increases the proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins by dissociating actin from myosin. [5] [6] Corticosteroids also induce myocyte apoptosis through\\xa0receptor-based signaling pathways as well as mitochondrial-based signaling pathways involving cytochrome c and the caspase cascade. [6] In terms of anti-anabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids inhibit amino acid transport into cells, inhibit muscle IGF-I production, and down-regulate differentiation of satellite cells into muscle fibers by blocking the transcription factor called myogenin, thus\\xa0inhibiting protein synthesis and myogenesis. Additionally, corticosteroids with high mineralocorticoid activity lower serum potassium and phosphate, which may contribute to muscle weakness. [5]'}\n",

It is where we manifest our insight, foresight, and planning capabilities into the actions that define who we are. Lesions in this area produce a number of neuropsychiatric disorders that tend to present with disinhibition, apathy, loss of initiative, and personality changes.

A hapten by itself is not immunogenic but becomes so after binding to a skin protein carrier. The hapten protein complex forms through covalent bonds between the hapten and amino acid side chains of target proteins within the skin. [8] The complex ultimately produces the sensitization of T cells. Sensitized T cells encountering the antigen at any time later will then lead to the release of cytokines, which in turn leads to macrophage activation and produces the immune response.

The glomerular capillary pressures force water and salts out of the blood into the Bowman's urinary space. The colloid osmotic pressures are primarily due to albumin, which keeps water in the capillaries.

The macula densa detects the increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an increase in salt concentration within the distal tubule filtrate. The macula densa responds by releasing substances that cause vasoconstriction, the afferent arteriole, decreasing blood flow and pressure, and thus normalizing GFR.

Additionally, the uterus is located superior and anterior aspect of the pelvis during the pregnancy. X-ray beams that project in a posterior to anterior (PA) direction contribute to less radiation than the beam projected in anterior to posterior (AP) direction because, in PA projection, the X-ray gets attenuated before reaching anteriorly located uterus.'}\n",

Bacterial species have different coping mechanisms for selective harsh environmental conditions. One of the most common coping mechanisms is forming spores to protect themselves against ecological degrading agents. Bacterial spores are the most dormant form of bacteria since they exhibit minimal metabolism, respiration, and reduced enzyme production. Typically, Gram-positive bacteria are best known for producing intracellular spores called endospores as a survival mechanism. Endospores are highly retractile and thick-walled structures formed inside bacterial cells. It is most common for Bacillus species and Clostridium species to create endospores. [1] B. cereus is a member of the Bacillus species and is well-known for its ability to cause foodborne illness due to its spores surviving various temperatures. Similarly, C. perfringens spores are acid-soluble proteins that resist chemicals and heat. [2]'}\n",

Further, bacterial spores can show typical viability signs at temperatures near absolute zero. Endospores are resistant to chemical agents, eg, triphenylmethane dyes, and can even protect the bacterial cells against ultraviolet radiation, extreme pH gradients, drought, and nutrition depletion. Endospores germinate back into vegetative cells (an active bacterial cell that undergoes metabolism)\\xa0when surrounding environmental conditions favor bacterial growth and reproduction. Several stimulants, such as optimal close-to-body temperature and diffusion of nutrients and water through bacterial cell walls by altering their surface tension, revert bacterial cells to their active vegetative cells. The process of spore formation is a multistep process. It starts from bacterial DNA replication, followed by the forespore formation, which is, by definition, the pinching of the cellular plasma membrane between the replicated chromosomes. Then, a cortex forms between the inner and outer membrane by extending the second cellular membrane to enclose the forespore with calcium and dipicolinic acid. Finally, the external spore coat surrounds the endospore before its release. [4]'}\n",

Microscopic examination to delineate the morphology of endospores involves differential staining processes such as malachite green and fluorescence staining techniques. Staining dormant bacterial samples with malachite green as the primary stain and safranine as the counteract stain results in the appearance of green oval endospores enclosed inside pink vegetative bacterial cells. [5] There are different locations of the endospores inside the bacterial cell. For instance, central endospores are located in the middle of the bacterial cell, while the terminal endospore appears at the end. A subterminal type of endospore appears between the cell's middle and end. [6] Despite their sturdy and resistant nature to environmental threats, endospores can be affected by certain eradication factors. During the 17th century, John Tyndall, a famous European physicist, discovered Tyndallization.

Injury to the IFP is usually the result of a single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma due to blunt impact, shear injury with ACL tear, dislocation of the patella, or a twisting injury at the knee. [8] Hoffa pad impingement syndrome has been well-documented as a source of anterior knee pain, commonly found in runners, cyclists, and soldiers. [9] The IFP is a potent source of pain due to its robust innervation by nociceptive Type IVa-free nerve endings and fibers targeted by substance P. [10] Substance P causes vasodilation, thereby promoting the recruitment of\\xa0immune cells and potentially contributing to edema development\\xa0within the tissue. This inflammatory process can cause thickening and fibrosis, leading to the loss of elastic properties of the IFP. [3] The scar tissue gradually accumulates and impinges at the intercondylar notch and trochlea, leading to a mechanical or painful block to full extension.

Hoffa first described the most accepted etiology of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome in 1904, which entailed IFP injury followed by associated bleeding, inflammation, hypertrophy, and eventual fibrosis. [15] Acute injury, repetitive microtrauma, and iatrogenic injury can lead to the initial cascade of events ending in fibrosis. Iatrogenic causes of IFP pathology include fibrosis due to arthroscopy portals, bone-patella tendon-bone autograft harvest during ACL reconstruction, or fat pad resection. [16] The clinical manifestations of other lesions inside IFP are comparable and often include swelling, knee discomfort, restricted range of motion, and an occasional palpable lump. Synovial lipomas, pigmented villonodular synovitis, glomus tumors, synovial chondromatosis, synovial haemangiomas, and ganglion cysts are among the possible causes. [17] [18] It results from repeated pinching of the exterior part of the fat pad between the cartilage of the lateral facet of the trochlea and the lateral patellofemoral ligament.

The utilization of wound dressings comprises the mainstay of non-surgical therapy, with a fundamental principle of employing debriding dressings for dirty wounds and occlusive dressings for clean wounds. A commonly used debriding dressing is the “wet-to-dry” dressing, in which gauze is dampened, then positioned into the wound base. Evaporation dries the dressing, which becomes slightly adherent to the wound surface. Necrotic debris and biofilm are removed with the dressing on subsequent exchanges, leaving healthy tissue behind. Wet-to-dry dressings work through mechanical debridement. Conceptually, establishing a clearly outlined regimen for frequency of dressing changes is most important for optimized success; generally, twice daily is recommended, although some may require heightened frequency. Debriding dressings are indicated in infected wounds or those containing necrotic debris. In clean wounds\\xa0lacking\\xa0necrotic debris with acceptable bacterial load(s), a dressing that maintains a moist environment should be utilized to encourage healing. This technique should not be employed for infected or dirty wounds. Occasionally, circumstances necessitate antibiotic dressings.

This technique should not be employed for infected or dirty wounds. Occasionally, circumstances necessitate antibiotic dressings. Mupirocin ointment has the added benefit of treating methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA). Burn wounds are commonly dressed with silver sulfadiazine or mafenide acetate due to their high antimicrobial activity. The low toxicity and exceptional antimicrobial properties of elemental silver have led to the development and widespread use of silver-impregnated wound dressings. Although multiple commercial variations in negative pressure wound therapy exist, all utilize a similar sponge-like material connected to a suction device. When applied appropriately and for the correct wound, negative pressure wound therapy can be efficacious and cost-effective. Negative pressure therapy, through extensive experimental and clinical trials, has confirmed the promotion of tissue perfusion, reduced edema, and, furthermore, favorably alters the wound-fluid composition and stimulates the formation of healthy granulation tissue. While negative pressure systems are easy to use and decrease the number of dressing changes, they are contraindicated in acutely infectious wounds.'}\n",

Hydrogels are advantageous\\xa0for keeping a relatively dry wound moist. Moisture-absorbing materials such as alginates are useful for drying out a weeping ulcer.

However, osteoporosis often goes clinically undetected until a fracture occurs, and early signs are challenging to identify through radiographic imaging.

The term acidemia is used to define the total acid-base status of the serum pH. For example, a patient can have multiple acidoses contributing to a net acidemia.

Further classification of metabolic acidosis is based on the presence or absence of an anion gap, or concentration of unmeasured serum anions.

Therefore, sodium\\xa0(Na), the primary plasma cation, is balanced by the sum of the anions bicarbonate and chloride in addition to the unmeasured anions, which represent the anion gap.

The anterior chamber is the area bounded by the cornea anteriorly, the angle laterally, and the lens and iris posteriorly. This space normally contains clear, aqueous humor produced by the ciliary body and drained through the Canal of Schlemm. The angle, an important anatomic location, is where the trabecular network and the Canal of Schlemm are located.

The critical process in penile erection activity is the relaxation of the intracavernosal smooth muscle.

[63] The paraventricular and medial preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus control this process. [63] Signals travel through the parasympathetic nervous system to the parasympathetic nerves of the S2-S4 sacral plexus and then to the penis via the cavernosal nerves.

An average functioning man has between 3 and 6 erections a night, with a mean duration greater than 30 minutes, maximal rigidity greater than 70% at both base and tip, as well as an increase in circumference of over 3 cm at the base and 2 cm at the tip. [79] This process is then repeated, usually for 3 nights. Men with purely psychogenic ED will typically demonstrate normal NPT tracings, while those with organic problems will show abnormal nocturnal erectile activity. Hypogonadism will often cause a decrease in rigidity while maintaining some tumescence in NPT studies. [80] [81] Today, NPT monitoring is rarely used or considered necessary to distinguish psychogenic from organic erectile dysfunction reliably. A careful and detailed personal and sexual history typically allows for the determination of significant psychogenic factors. [71]'}\n",

[82] This test may also be helpful after penile trauma, post-priapism, Peyronie disease, and in patients with ED who fail to respond to oral agents. [82] The ultrasound is typically done by giving the patient an intracavernosal injection of a vasoactive drug, usually 20 μg of prostaglandin E1. (This also serves as a clinical trial of penile injection therapy.) Following the injection, the peak systolic velocities (PSV) are measured. A normal value is > 35 cm/s, while a reading of < 25 cm/s suggests arterial insufficiency. The value of < 25 cm/s was found to have 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity for patients with abnormal pudendal arteriography.

Ultrasound can also demonstrate cavernous veno-occlusive dysfunction, often called \"venous leak\" by patients; this finding represents the failure of penile corporal rigidity despite adequate arterial inflow. Venous leak becomes evident when rapid detumescence occurs despite normal peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities (EDV > 5 cm/s). [84] Measuring the vascular resistive index (RI) can aid in the diagnosis of veno-occlusive dysfunction. Calculate RI using the formula: RI = (PSV-EDV)/PSV. An RI < 0.75 is consistent with veno-occlusive dysfunction. [85] The main benefits of this investigation are its non-invasiveness and its ability to exclude both penile arterial and venous dysfunctions accurately. However, the results are very user-dependent, and abnormal anatomy can give erroneous readings. Further, the information provided would remain the same treatment for most patients.

The most common pattern of glaucomatous optic nerve thinning occurs at the inferior and superior portions of the optic nerve.

Patients with OAG have greater depth at the optic cup floor, possibly due to increased IOP pressure. One study examined the lamina cribrosa using Heidelberg retina tomograph and found greater topographic variability and \"spikiness\" when looking at the lamina cribrosa of patients with OAG; this is most likely a sign of fragility in the lamina, as increased spikiness is inversely related to Humphrey mean deviation ( P < 0.05), and cup-disc ratio ( P < 0.004) and was directly related to nerve fiber layer thickness ( P < 0.005).

Comprehensive knowledge of normal and abnormal tracheal and bronchial anatomy is necessary when performing lung isolation. The trachea is a fibromuscular tube with an internal diameter ranging from 15 to 25 mm in men and 10 to 21 mm in women. The trachea is supported anteriorly by 16 to 20 incomplete cartilaginous rings and posteriorly by a strip of longitudinal smooth muscle. These landmarks aid in orientation during bronchoscopy. The trachea divides sharply at the carina, giving rise to the right and left mainstem bronchi. Because the right mainstem trajectory closely parallels the trachea, right mainstem intubation is common when an endotracheal tube is inserted blindly beyond the carina.'}\n",

Physiologically, under normal conditions, both lungs receive air for ventilation and blood flow for perfusion, facilitated by gravitational forces.

In the lateral decubitus position, common for thoracic surgeries, the nonoperated lung is the dependent lung and receives more perfusion.

Furthermore, surgical manipulation of the nonventilated lung reduces blood flow, directing more blood to the ventilated lung.

FEV1 serves as a predictor of postoperative complications, including mortality following pulmonary resection. Several studies indicate that a preoperative FEV1 that is less than 60% predicted is the most robust predictor of postoperative complications. Therefore, a cutoff of 60% for FEV1 and DLCO is utilized to assess postoperative risk. [24] [25] [26]'}\n",

It incorporates elements such as adipose tissue, adventitia, and neurovascular sheaths, aponeuroses, deep and superficial fasciae, epineurium, joint capsules, ligaments, membranes, meninges, myofascial expansions, periosteum, retinacula, septa, tendons, visceral fasciae, and all the intramuscular and intermuscular connective tissues including endo-/peri-/epimysium. The fascial system interpenetrates and surrounds all organs, muscles, bones and nerve fibers, endowing the body with a functional structure, and providing an environment that enables all body systems to operate in an integrated manner.” This is the broadest definition of fascia.

            "{'dataset': 'statpearls', 'text_index': '332308#0', 'chunk': 'Sutures And Needles -- Issues of Concern. The first main suture category is absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures. Sutures are considered absorbable if they lose most of their tensile strength over variable periods ranging from a few weeks to several months. [2] [5] [6] [7] Absorbable sutures are often employed for deep temporary closure until the tissues heal or when it is not easy to remove them otherwise. In this fashion, they are useful for approximating edges of tissue layers, closing deep spaces or defects, and facilitating wound\\xa0healing as part of a multi-layered closure. [1] [2] [5] [9] When used superficially, they can have more inflammation, which can lead to more scarring. If using absorbable sutures superficially, the recommendation is that a rapidly\\xa0absorbing suture is employed. [1]'}\n",
            "{'dataset': 'statpearls', 'text_index': '332309#0', 'chunk': 'Sutures And Needles -- Issues of Concern. Absorbable sutures can also classify as natural and synthetic sutures. Natural sutures are derived from purified\\xa0animal tissues (usually collagen) and are sometimes made of the purified serosa of bovine intestines. [9] [10] Silk\\xa0and catgut (made from sheep submucosa) are all types of natural sutures. [2] Natural sutures differ from synthetic sutures in that they degrade (if absorbable, like catgut) by proteolysis, while synthetic sutures degrade by hydrolysis. Hydrolysis causes less of an inflammatory reaction than proteolysis, which is why natural sutures can be known for causing more inflammation at the suture site. [2] [6] [4] [10] Catgut sutures can be treated with an aldehyde solution to strengthen the material (plain catgut sutures) and can undergo further treatment with chromium trioxide (which also strengthens and helps them last longer before absorption) like chromic catgut.

            "{'dataset': 'statpearls', 'text_index': '332311#0', 'chunk': 'Sutures And Needles -- Issues of Concern. Another important suture category is monofilament and multifilament. Monofilament sutures are single filaments (as their name implies) with less surface area than a multifilament (braided or twisted suture). [2] [5] [9] Monofilament sutures have higher memory which demands more handling care. Memory is the tendency of a suture to return to its original shape and makes the suture more prone to knot loosening. It should be addressed by holding the suture and slightly tugging it. They typically require more knots to ensure security but tend to fracture less than multifilament sutures. Monofilament sutures also pass through tissues more easily and cause a less inflammatory reaction than their multifilament counterparts. [2] [9] [10]'}\n",

Conversely, multifilament sutures are more pliable; they hold knots more securely, have less memory, and are easier to handle\\xa0by the surgeon. However, multifilament sutures also cause more friction through tissue and have increased capillarity and surface area, increasing their proclivity to inflammation and infection. [2] [5] [6] [9] Multifilament sutures can be coated to make them slide through tissues more easily and have properties more similar to a monofilament suture. They can also be coated with antibiotics to make them more infection-resistant. However, they are more expensive than traditional sutures. [2] [4]'}\n",

Another critical property of a suture is its tensile or breaking strength, which\\xa0generally comes from suture width. Sutures are numbered by their size relative to their diameter. Thick suture numbering is from 0-10, with #10 being the largest diameter. Thin sutures are those that have the greatest number of zeroes after them and range from 1-0 to 12-0 (12-0 having the least breaking strength).

The needle is made up of three main parts, the eye, body, and point. [2] [5] [10] The eye is where the suture attaches to the needle; this can be an actual needle eye, where the string threads through or a point where the suture thread gets swaged onto the needle (most modern needles are of this latter type). The body is the most substantial part of the needle and connects the eye to the point and determines the shape of the needle. The needle can be straight or curved, which is more common. The circle of a\\xa0curved needle comes in different lengths, but most curves are 1/4,\\xa01/2, 3/8, or 1/3 of a circle.

There is no specific algorithm for suture choice; however, a few rules are helpful. For instance, if there is a high infection risk, a monofilament absorbable suture is chosen. For running intradermal sutures, thin monofilament absorbable sutures with minimal reactivity are typically used. [9] When suturing the skin, particularly in cosmetically sensitive areas, the smallest suture for the area should be used.

            "{'dataset': 'statpearls', 'text_index': '332323#0', 'chunk': 'Sutures And Needles -- Clinical Significance. For absorbable sutures, if more strength is required, one can choose a suture with a longer absorption time. Slow healing tissues, like fascia and tendons, should be closed with non-absorbable or slow absorbing sutures, while faster healing tissues like the stomach, colon, and bladder require absorbable sutures. [11] Urinary and biliary tracts are prone to stone formation, so synthetic absorbable sutures are better in this situation, while sutures prone to digestive juices should be those that last longer. Natural sutures do very badly in the GI tract.

In general, surgeons typically use either polypropylene or polydioxanone sutures for fascia, depending on how strong the repair needs to be. Polypropylene is also very common in cardiovascular surgery. Deep dermis closure is with either polyglycolic acid or poliglecaprone 25 sutures. If closing the epidermis with a running subcuticular suture, poliglecaprone 25 is preferred. If one is performing interrupted sutures on the skin surface, nylon is ideal; polydioxanone for near dark hair and fast absorbing or chromic gut suture if it is on a child or in an area where sutures are difficult to remove.

Skull fractures are common injuries observed in the setting of both blunt and penetrating trauma. The frontal sinuses are located within the frontal bone, superior and medial to the orbits. The frontal sinuses begin developing around 5 to 6 years of age and become fully developed between the ages of 12 and 20. Sensation is provided by both the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves, which are branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1). The blood supply to the frontal sinuses comes from the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries. The frontal sinuses consist of bony anterior and posterior tables (walls) and they drain inferiorly, medially, and posteriorly via the frontal recess into either the middle meatus or ethmoid infundibulum, depending on the attachment of the uncinate process of the ethmoid bone. If the uncinate process attaches to the lamina papyracea, the frontal sinus drains into the middle meatus via the semilunar hiatus. If the uncinate process attaches to the skull base or the middle turbinate, the frontal sinus drains into the ethmoid infundibulum before emptying into the middle meatus.'}\n",

[13] A sufficient impedance from one of these sources can cause infarction and subsequent tissue necrosis. Inflammatory mediators from ischemic parenchyma can further limit gas exchange following the resultant vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction. [16] When ischemia of lung tissue is not reversed promptly, infarction ensues. A unilateral infarct occurs in 77% to 87% of pulmonary infarctions, with the strongest predilection for the right lower lobe. Multiple studies show a stark predominance of pulmonary infarction in the lower lobes relative to the upper lobes.

[3] It was later noted that following infarction, hemorrhage and then edema ensued into the alveoli distally. Histologically, it is characterized by organized thrombi and hemorrhage surrounding a core of necrotic alveoli with adjacent structures (see Image. Pulmonary Embolism). [7] In some cases, this is reversible, whereby the intra-alveolar blood is resorbed in 2-4 days. If the process is not reversed, hemosiderin is formed from the intra-alveolar erythrocytes, and infarction of the surrounding lung parenchyma is seen within 1-2 days.

The differential diagnosis of abdominal cramping accompanied by nausea and vomiting is overwhelmingly broad. It demands a finely detailed history to further tease out an etiology as well as directed treatments. In addition to infectious and neurologic causes of said symptoms, it is important to remember potential chemical causes responsible for clinical pictures featuring abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. In 2004, a peculiar syndrome of vomiting associated with chronic cannabis use appeared in the literature with the curious historical qualifier that symptoms seemed to be relieved with hot showering or bathing. [1] [2] This syndrome came to be known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). With the increasing use of cannabis among all manner of age groups, especially recreationally among adolescents\\xa0as well as medically for use as an antiemetic in chemotherapy-induced vomiting, appetite stimulant in those with cachexia, and analgesic (e.g., for peripheral neuropathies) and as an antispasmodic in multiple sclerosis, it is important to recognize this phenomenon’s risk factors and presentation in both emergency and primary care.

When noxious stimuli are perceived (which may be anything, including a fearful sight, a foul odor, or even a distressing memory), the area postrema of the brain is activated, leading to vagal stimulation. The resultant neuro-endocrine mediated processes result in salivation, closure of the glottis to protect the person’s airway from aspiration, relaxation of the stomach’s sphincters, retroperistalsis of small intestinal contents to the stomach, and finally contraction of stomach and abdominal muscles to propel vomitus to the mouth and into the environment. The gastrointestinal tract itself has several receptors, including cannabinoids, histamine, and other chemical agents, which can serve to directly influence the process of vomiting when stimulated directly, in addition to stimulation from the nervous system.

One matter is, by virtue of its name and potential etiology, certain patients may be hesitant to offer historical clues (e.g., illicit drug use) to clinicians, which may complicate the clinician’s ability to rule in or rule out specific diagnoses. Another barrier to diagnosis includes the close resemblance of CHS to other pathologies, such as cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS), also known as abdominal migraine due to such patients often having concurrent migraine-like symptoms, besides the fact that occasionally cannabis is used to treat CVS.

Between 3 and 5% of the world's population has used cannabis at least once, with the majority of usages having been for non-prescribed purposes. Age is a significant correlation of cannabis smoking, and different countries vary in terms of age of the earliest use of cannabis. Approximately fifty percent of people in the United States have their first use of marijuana around the age of 20 years old. In the United States, there is male to female parity during adolescent years for the age of first marijuana usage.

The present hypothesis is that CHS may result from chronic overstimulation of endocannabinoid receptors, leading to derangements in the body’s intrinsic control of nausea and vomiting.

Per the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics , cyclic vomiting syndrome is defined by having sudden onset episodes of vomiting, having at least four bouts of vomiting per hour, and often having 12 to 15 episodes of vomiting per day. These episodes of vomiting are often separated by weeks or months, and there is a return to baseline between episodes.

When there is a restriction to the normal flow of urine through the urinary tract, there will be a back pressure of urine into the collecting system of the kidneys. In time, this may produce dilatation within the tract, and as the kidneys filtration system becomes affected, it becomes the primary reason for the development of obstructive nephropathy. The mechanism of nephropathy, in this case, involves many factors, including local ischemia due to distention and increased intratubular pressures. In a partial obstruction, angiotensin and AT1-receptor appear to be upregulated, increasing ureteral peristalsis to help relieve the obstruction. [10]'}\n",

Duodenal ulcers are part of a broader disease state categorized as peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease refers to the clinical presentation and disease state that occurs when there is a disruption in the mucosal surface at the level of the stomach or first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Anatomically, both the gastric and duodenal surfaces contain a defense system that includes pre-epithelial, epithelial, and subepithelial elements. Ulceration occurs from damage to the mucosal surface that extends beyond the superficial layer. While the majority of duodenal ulcers present with dyspepsia as the primary associated symptom, the presentation can range in levels of severity, including gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, perforation, or fistula development. The management, therefore, is highly dependent on the patient's presentation at the time of diagnosis or progression of the disease. The diagnosis of duodenal vs. gastric ulcer merits consideration in patients with symptoms of dyspepsia/upper abdominal pain who also report a history of NSAID use or previous Helicobacter pylori diagnosis.\"}\n",

Other causes of duodenal ulcers include etiologies that, in similar ways to NSAIDs and H. pylori , disrupt the lining of the duodenum.

According to multiple studies that have evaluated the prevalence of duodenal ulcers, they are estimated to occur in about 5 to 15% of the Western population. [2] Previously, the recurrence and prevalence rates were extremely high due to a lack of identification and effective treatment of H. pylori . Most recently, a systematic review of seven studies discovered the rates to be significantly lower. However, the variability was thought to be due to the prevalence of H. pylori in the population studied as well as the guidelines for diagnosis utilized, including endoscopic guidelines. In areas with a higher incidence of H. pylori , however, the rates were noted to be the highest, which in turn supports the previously established notion that H. pylori infection presents significant comorbidity for the development of duodenal ulcers. [3] The overall decline in rates of diagnosis of duodenal ulcers is also attributable to developing physician and patient awareness regarding the use of NSAIDs and potential complications that can be associated with misuse as well as the slowly declining rates of smoking amongst younger individuals as research has also been found this to be another confounding comorbidity.'}\n",

Most patients with peptic ulcer disease, up to 70%, are asymptomatic. Overall, dyspepsia is the most common symptom for patients who do experience symptoms. As noted above, the degree of disease progression before the initial diagnosis can affect the symptoms with which a patient may present. The location of the disease can also be differentiated based on symptoms.

The evaluation process will depend on what studies the patient may have had completed for the previous assessment of their symptoms.

If the patient has undergone EGD, biopsies can be obtained and further tested with a urease test and histology. Less invasive options include a urea breath test, stool antigen test, and serological tests. Serology is less common, as this can remain positive if the patient has been previously infected and does not necessarily represent active infection. The urea breath test has high specificity.

Spasticity has a wide range of etiologies, including brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, trauma, and spinal cord injury. In a study looking at the prevalence of spasticity in stroke populations, 42.6% of stroke patients developed spasticity, and severe spasticity occurred in 15.6% of patients. Another study looking at the prevalence of spasticity in cerebral palsy found spastic subtypes in 90% of the patients studied. The impact of severe spasticity on a patient’s life is far-reaching, affecting everything from activities of daily living to mental health and even income. On the other hand, spasticity can be helpful in patients with weak limbs, especially in the lower extremities, by enabling the patient to transfer or ambulate with less assistance.

However, before joining together to become the basilar artery, the vertebral arteries each give off a branch which becomes the anterior spinal artery; the anterior spinal artery travels caudally down the spinal cord through the anterior sulcus. [4] The posterior spinal arteries can branch off the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or branches from the pre-atlantal vertebral arteries which also travel caudally down the spinal cord but through the two posterior sulci. [5] The ASA provides blood to the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, and the PSA delivers blood to the posterior one-third of the spinal cord.'}\n",

The anterior spinal artery and PSA are fed additional arteries throughout their course down the spinal cord at each spinal level through the intervertebral foramen. These additional arteries are called segmental spinal arteries. The segmental arteries then bifurcate into an anterior and posterior radicular artery which feed into both anterior and posterior spinal arteries respectively. Not only can they supply the ASA/PSA but also provide blood supply to the nerve roots along which they track. Theoretically there should be 31 radicular arteries for each foramen that receives an artery, but in reality, there is always less. [2] Sometimes, however, the spinal segmental arteries also give off segmental medullary arteries which directly feed into the anterior spinal artery and posterior spinal arteries, however, the numbers differ between person to person. There are thought to be anywhere from 8 to 10 in every person.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies may be pathogenic in EED.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an ultrafiltrate of plasma contained within the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid spaces of the cranium and spine.

[2] Adult CSF volume is estimated to be 150 ml, with a distribution of 125 ml within the subarachnoid spaces and 25 ml within the ventricles. CSF is predominantly secreted by the choroid plexus with other sources playing a more poorly defined role. In the adult population, its secretion varies between individuals, usually ranging from 400 to 600 ml per day. The constant secretion of CSF contributes to complete CSF renewal four to five times per 24-hour period in the average young adult. The reduction of CSF turnover may contribute to the accumulation of metabolites seen in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The composition of CSF is strictly regulated, and any variation can be useful for diagnostic purposes. [1]'}\n",

Seventy to eighty\\xa0percent of CSF production is via a network of modified ependymal cells known as the choroid plexus (CP).

This simple cuboidal epithelium surrounds clusters of fenestrated capillaries allowing for the filtration of plasma. [3] CP cells have dense microvilli present on their apical surface. They are interconnected via tight junctions, creating a blood-CSF barrier that helps control the composition of CSF. [1]'}\n",

As there is no appreciable barrier between the CSF and the extracellular space of the brain (ECSB), the blood-CSF barrier also serves to regulate the environment of the brain. [2] Larger substances such as cells, protein, and glucose are not allowed passage, whereas ions and small molecules such as vitamins and nutrients can pass into the CSF relatively easily. [4] Water is allowed passage through the CP epithelium via epithelial AQP1 channels. Substances that may not pass through the blood-CSF barrier, but are needed by the brain can be actively synthesized by or actively transported through the CP epithelial cells into the CSF. A 5-mV lumen positive voltage potential is present across CP epithelial cell membranes. This electrical potential difference pulls sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate ions from the plasma into the CSF, creating an osmotic gradient which then drives the movement of water into the CSF.

Blocked CSF flow throughout the ventricles is classified as non-communicating, or obstructive, hydrocephalus. The blockage is often a mass such as a tumor or an abscess located within a foramen. Because CSF secretion is constant, obstruction of flow will lead to CSF build up in front of the blockage. For example, stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct, one of the most common causes of obstructive hydrocephalus, leads to enlargement of both lateral ventricles as well as the third ventricle.

The granulomatous nature of GCA contributes to the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers, potentially leading to aneurysm formation and vascular remodeling. Intimal hyperplasia and lumen occlusion contribute to ischemic complications.'}\n",

The spectrum of manifestations in GCA varies, ranging from cranial engagement evidenced by constitutional symptoms, headache, and jaw claudication and a positive temporal artery biopsy to the involvement of large vessels, characterized by nonspecific systemic symptoms and observable vasculitis on imaging. Vision loss, a severe complication primarily manifesting as transient monocular visual loss, necessitates early recognition and treatment with high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, possibly combined with interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonists. Notably associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, management involves considering the diverse clinical presentations and potential surgical interventions for vascular complications. The management approach for GCA with large vessel involvement mirrors\\xa0that without large vessel involvement, with additional considerations such as antiplatelet therapy for selected patients. Considering the diverse clinical presentations and treatment options, a comprehensive approach is essential in addressing the complexities of GCA.'}\n",

Survival analysis is widely used in evidence-based medicine to examine the time-to-event series. [1] Often used for survival/death events, time-to-event series can illustrate time to any dichotomous event. [2] Examples: the number of days before treatment allows an individual to go into remission; or the severity grade of disease and the hours in the hospital before being released. Using this method, one can compare patients and/or groups of patients. [1] Relationships between more than one group can use Kaplan-Meier estimations and log-rank tests, which are both nonparametric. Researchers interested in quantifying the effect of the comparison(s) can use Cox proportional hazard models.

The survival function is the probability of surviving (or not experiencing an event) up to a specified time point, whereas hazard rate is the rate of occurrence for the event within a given period. [3] To determine survival time, one must know the time of the original event at origin and the time of the final event.

[3] Essentially, censoring means that the outcome of interest for that subject cannot be determined based on the study. [5] Survival analysis examines the time before an individual or group experiences the event or outcome of interest or until censored.

Life tables (also known as actuarial life tables) differ from other methods of survival analysis in that the observation outputs categorize into distinct time events. [6] [7] Life tables present outputs that show whether the case occurred, whether the individual was censored, and the time to that event. [8] When examining a life table, one can determine the proportion of patients experiencing an event (e.g., dying) during which interval the outcome occurred. Life tables can also denote which individuals were censored and which were not (experienced the event in the timeframe). Within these life tables, one should assume no changes in experiencing an event at different intervals. For example, if patients with breast cancer received a second drug halfway through the treatment, they may be less likely to experience the event of dying, thus potentially invalidating results. Life tables remain useful, but in 1958, Kaplan and Meier proposed a new method that removed the pre-fixed time interval requirement.

[10] The KM plots a survival curve, which often reports median survival time(s), a reliable estimate if the majority of the observations are uncensored. [7] One can calculate confidence intervals (CIs) for KM probabilities and plot CIs in the survival curves to provide a range of possible values for the population based on the sample.

Transcutaneous blepharoplasty is usually indicated in cases with skin and muscle laxity, with or without fat prolapse. Traditionally, the skin is incised 1 mm below the lash line in the subciliary area. Once the skin is incised, there are two possible variations that are named depending upon the plane of dissection. A 'skin flap' can be raised, elevating the thin eyelid skin off of the orbicularis oculi muscle. In 1951, Castanares\\xa0described the 'skin-flap' technique as best suited for eyelids with excess lax skin and atonic orbicularis muscle. [2] The second technique is termed the 'skin-muscle' flap, where the orbicularis oculi muscle is incised as it attaches to the tarsal plate, and the plane of dissection is deep to the orbicularis and superficial to the orbital septum. Mcindoe-Beare\\xa0popularized this technique and proposed its use in younger patients with robust orbicularis muscle tone. [3]\"}\n",

Regardless of the specific plane of dissection used, lower lid malpositions, particularly ectropion, may be encountered in the subciliary approach owing to contractile scarring that everts the lash line and grey line away from the globe. The most common causes of this complication include unaddressed eyelid laxity, overzealous skin excision, denervation of the orbicularis, breach of the orbital septum, or unfavorable scarring. A meticulous preoperative examination can identify eyelid laxity, which must then be addressed at the time of blepharoplasty. In an effort to avoid the potential for ectropion, Bourget introduced the transconjunctival approach, which was popularized by Zarem and Resnik\\xa0as beneficial in avoiding ectropion.

It behooves the surgeon to be familiar with both approaches, allowing treatment to be tailored to the patient. Maffi et al. reviewed 2007 patients over a period of 30-years who underwent traditional transcutaneous blepharoplasty without additional support by a senior experienced surgeon and reported only 0.4% symptomatic lid malposition post-surgery, which supports the safety and effectiveness of this procedure.

Contemporary lower lid blepharoplasty has also benefitted from advances in the understanding of the anatomical changes of the aging face, the importance of orbicularis retaining ligament (ORL), the orbitomalar sulcus deformity, and tear trough deformity. Current literature focuses on smoothing the lid-cheek junction for a more youthful look using techniques like the release of retaining ligaments, fat transposition, and mid-face augmentations. Also, lid-anchoring procedures have been emphasized to treat any lid laxity. Although these techniques for lid-cheek junction smoothing can be accomplished through the transconjunctival approach, the transcutaneous approach allows the excellent field of exposure for fat transposition, ORL release, midface-lift procedures as well as lateral canthal tightening procedures with the additional advantage of skin redraping.'}\n",

The sulcus separates the superior bulge from the inferior. The sulcus is referred to as tear trough deformity medially and laterally as the lid-cheek junction.

Similarly, malar sulcus or lid-cheek junction starts from malar prominence and extends until it blends with nasojugal sulcus in the subcutaneous plane. But in the sub-orbicularis plane, the orbicularis muscle is not directly attached to the bone; it is through a ligament (the ORL).

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common ailment affecting the general patient population. It is the most common cause of peripheral nerve compression, with an incidence of 99 in 100,000 people. CTS is most commonly seen in patients over 40 years of age and has a greater prevalence in women, as they comprise approximately 65% to 75% of all reported cases [1] . CTS results from compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel in the wrist. [2] Typically, the pressure within the carpal tunnel in these patients can be 32 to 110 mm Hg compared to 2 to 31 mm Hg in normal patients. [3] The compression of the median nerve causes the classic pain distribution and/or paresthesias seen in CTS on the palmar aspect of the hand. The classic distribution involves the area innervated by the median nerve, including the volar aspect of the thumb, index finger, long finger, and the radial volar half of the ring finger. Risk factors for the development of CTS include obesity, pregnancy (especially later in pregnancy), age, trauma to the wrist, and inflammatory rheumatic disorders.'}\n",

[4] Controversy exists whether or not overuse is a contributing factor (such as daily typing). Conservative treatment options include keeping the wrist immobile using wrist splints, physiotherapy, and pain medications, both topically and systemically. [5] More invasive options include local steroid injections to the carpal tunnel and surgical decompression of the space. This article will focus on injection techniques for CTS.'}\n",

The exact etiology of CTS is not completely known, but the condition is largely assumed to be idiopathic or multifactorial. Some of the suspected risk factors for CTS include diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, hypothyroidism, menopause, obesity, arthritis, and age. [6] Diabetes seems to have the greatest association with CTS, with a prevalence rate of 30% in patients with diabetic neuropathy and 14% in patients without neuropathic symptoms. [7] Hormonal changes may be a contributing factor since pregnancy, menopause, and hypothyroidism are associated with CTS. Mechanical risk factors, including inflammation, thickening, arthritic deformity, and bony irregularities, contribute to median nerve compression.'}\n",

The carpal tunnel is located in the volar aspect of the wrist between the carpal bones and flexor retinaculum. [8] The boundaries of the carpal tunnel include the floor of carpal bones and the roof formed by the flexor retinaculum. The carpal tunnel contains the median nerve as well as 9 tendons (flexor pollicis longus, 4 flexor digitorum superficialis, and 4 flexor digitorum profundus). Increased pressure within the tunnel causes pain in the distribution of the median nerve within the hand. The median nerve is formed by a confluence of the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. The nerve supplies motor innervation to the thenar muscles and sensory innervation to the radial 3.5 fingers. The median nerve supplies sensation to the radial half of the fourth finger. The ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the ulnar (or medial) half of the fourth finger.'}\n",

The affected wrist is supinated in slight dorsiflexion using a rolled-up towel and taping the fingers down. An ultrasound linear array probe can be used to scan the wrist for any anatomical variants, such as volar ganglion cysts, flexor tendon tenosynovitis, and tumors. [11] The probe is then placed transversely at the proximal wrist crease by the entrance to the carpal tunnel. The goal is to have the pisiform, ulnar nerve, and ulnar artery in view as well as the median nerve. Doppler imaging can aid in determining vascular structures. The median nerve is identified and most often edematous. The injectate is targeted around the nerve in a target sign.

The nerve should separate from the flexor retinaculum located anteriorly. This hydrodissection should reduce any adhesions which may have caused entrapment.
